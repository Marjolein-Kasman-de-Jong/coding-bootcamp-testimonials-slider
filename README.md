# Coding Bootcamp Testimonials Slider

[Frontend Mentor Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/coding-bootcamp-testimonials-slider-4FNyLA8JL)

The challenge was to build out the slider and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Users should be able to:

* Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard
* View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
* See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
